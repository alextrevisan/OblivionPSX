/* Polygon clip detection code
 *
 * The polygon clipping logic is based on the Cohen-Sutherland algorithm, but
 * only the off-screen detection logic is used to determine which polygon edges
 * are off-screen.
 *
 * In tri_clip, the following edges are checked as follows:
 *
 *  |\
 *  |  \
 *  |    \
 *  |      \
 *  |--------
 *
 * In quad_clip, the following edges are checked as follows:
 *
 *  |---------|
 *  | \     / |
 *  |   \ /   |
 *  |   / \   |
 *  | /     \ |
 *  |---------|
 *
 * The inner portion of the quad is checked, otherwise the quad will be
 * culled out if the camera faces right into it, where all four edges
 * are off-screen at once.
 *
