				Specifies a subdirectory to the directory structure. <file> and <dir> elements inside
				the element will be stored inside it.
				
				Attributes:
					name	- Specifies the name of the subdirectory.
					srcdir	- Specifies the directory path to the source files if no source attribute is
							  specified to the <file> elements (optional, can be a relative or absolute path).

			<!-- <dummy>
				Specifies an invisible dummy file to be generated into the file system. Use this to
				add dummy sectors, usually at the end of the file system portion of the image to avoid
				the possibility of 'drive runaway' which can damage a drive mechanism.
				
				The dummy file is completely invisible as it is not added into the directory records
				of the ISO image entirely which ensures a clean directory structure when the file system is
				viewed on a file browser.
				
				Attributes:
					sectors	- Size of dummy file in sector units (1024 = 2MB).

			<!-- Sample DA audio file entry.
			
				Unlike XA and STR file types, DA files can only be put last in the ISO file system as
				the file will be packed as raw CD audio data and you cannot put file data past a CD
				audio track. It will also be mapped as a conventional CD audio track in the CUE sheet.
				
				You can still use <track> elements after this.

	<!-- Specifies CD-DA audio tracks to the CD image
	
		WAV files must be in Microsoft format, 44100KHz 16-bit stereo, uncompressed. Mkpsxiso will not perform
		transcoding if the input file format is not correct.
		
		Plans for supporting FLAC as source audio were considered but dropped because Lameguy64 found it to
		be impossible to compile libflac under Windows and that most people usually use XA audio over CDDA anyway.
